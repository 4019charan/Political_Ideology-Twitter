# Political_Ideology-Twitter

Welcome to my project! In this repository, I explore the Democrat vs. Republican Tweets dataset to analyze trends and insights.

## Dataset
I used the [Democrat Vs. Republican Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapastor/democratvsrepublicantweets) dataset from Kaggle. This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of tweets from both political perspectives.

Feel free to explore the dataset and use it for your own analyses.
